# Review

## Scope reviewed

Planning structure only: one Phase 6 PR with five ordered implementation/review checkpoints,
the shared Full-tier record, acceptance gates and migration compatibility exception.

## Findings

2026-09-09: independent Standards and Spec passes completed in parallel. No planning findings.
Both plans and this record consistently express the agreed five checkpoints within one PR, permit
fix commits, retain the separate-release exception, and preserve the durable phase exit gates.
Caller/table inventory and rollout decisions are explicitly prerequisites, not claimed evidence.

Disposition: planning structure clear. Implementation review and checkpoint dispositions remain
pending; this review does not approve unspecified schema, contract or stock-state changes.

## Residual risk

Caller/table inventory and concrete tests remain to be specified before dependent implementation.
The migration release sequence and global stock-state compatibility remain unresolved; the spec
requires these decisions before the affected changes. No runtime readiness is claimed.
